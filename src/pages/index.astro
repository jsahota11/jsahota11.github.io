			<p>
				Hey there! My name is Jatinder, and this is my personal webpage. I am currently pursuing a Joint Honours degree in<br>
				Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Manitoba, with a minor in Statistics.<br>
				More specifically, my interests lie in discrete algorithms and computational geometry, as well as Number theory and Topology. I also enjoy<br>
				programming, specifically low-level systems programming, and developed more interest in programming embedded and operating systems.<br>
				<br>
				I am currently learning fullstack web development in my free time, but usually I like to read. More textbooks than story books.<br>
				<br>
				On this website, you will find information about myself, including more about my own personal life and interests,<br>
				projects and experiences, as well as a deeper dive into my hobbies, interests, and motivation. I encourage you stick around and read,<br>
				and check back in every once in a while to see how the site has changed. I will most likely add a page for updates recently made to the website,<br>
				or I may merge it with the already existing Updates page. We will see! I will upload my resume when it is updated.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for reading,<br>
				Jatinder<br>
