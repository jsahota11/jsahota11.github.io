### Hello! My name is Jatinder, and this is the repo for my personal website.

* I will be sure to spruce up the website and this README in due time.

* For now, keep an eye on the repository and the published page to see new changes!

##### TODO:
* Fix the repo so edits are on main, deployments on gh-pages
* Fix line breaks so text does not look goofy
* Integrate flexbox more to make it more mobile-friendly
* Add things to do to todo.
* Add different transition that works with non-Chromium API (or just remove it entirely)
